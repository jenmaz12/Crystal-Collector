# Crystal Collector Game
#### https://jenmaz12.github.io/Crystal-Collector/
The Crystal Collector Game was created using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The goal of the game is for the user to get their total to match the target number by clicking on crystals with different, hidden values. The target number is a random integer between 19 and 120. The crystals' values are hidden from the user and are randomly chosen each game from an array of integers from 1 to 12. As the user clicks on each crystal, that crystal's value for that game, captured in a data attribute for that crystal, is added to their score. If the user's total exceeds the target number, the user loses, one is added to their loss count, their score resets to zero, and new target and crystal numbers are chosen.
